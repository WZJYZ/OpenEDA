 /*
  * A peudo-random pattern generator (PRPG).
  *
  * A PRPG implements a LFSR and calculates returned vectors of values based on
  * this LFSR. By using this object as opposed to pure-random vectors (i.e.,
  * using the built-in ValueVectorFunction::random function), generated stimulus
  * will be 1) more predictable, which will make debugging attempts more
  * consistent, and 2) more representitive of hardware-applied tests.
  *
  * The LFSR implemented here is a 31-bit external LFSR. All vectors generated
  * are presumed to be part of a scan chain fed by the LSB of this LFSR. This
  * implies sequential vectors generated by the PRPG are highly correlated to
  * eachother, as they will be the shifted result of the previous vector with
  * a single bit difference.
  *
  * Unless otherwise specified, the LFSR is loaded with an "all 1s" seed.
  *
  * @param _primitive The underlying data primitive to simulate.
